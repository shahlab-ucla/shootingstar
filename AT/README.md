AceTree open source imaging analysis software from Starrynite project

Note that the master branch is not the most current AceTree, the image loading refactor branch is currently (10/2/2019) the most up to date. 

Sample data and combined starrynite Acetreee distrubutions of various vintages can be found on the project website: http://starrynite.sourceforge.net/

AceTree developers prefer the IntelliJ IDE, though Eclipse and others can also be used.

**NOTE instructions for setting up IDE projects etc for each of the Bao lab software packages can be found in the top level git repository Developer Documentation.  

AceTree requires JRE 8 and uses the java compiler version 1.8.

We encourage and welcome changes to the codebase. For information about setting up the project, navigating the codebase or anything else, contact Anthony Santella santella@mskcc.org or Braden Katzman at bradenkatzman@gmail.com.
